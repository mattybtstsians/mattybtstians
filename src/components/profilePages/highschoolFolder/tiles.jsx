        You won't regret coming to SYDE - unless you hate making friends, getting jobs, and having fun!

        Do your research! Not as design based as you may assume.
      </div>
      <div className="tiles">
        It is absolutely what you make of it!

        It’s just a program, it won’t make that much of a difference but it’s not a bad one. :)

        Try out many different things in high school, not just things related to engineering
      </div>
      <div className="tiles">
        Try your best but don't base your worth on university acceptances or grades. If you work hard you'll be successful, whether that's in SYDE or not. Having said this, if SYDE's your goal, make sure you pursue things that interest you in high school, even if they don't necessarily relate to engineering. They want to see your personality and your enthusiasm, not just your grades. You've got this
      </div>
      <div className="tiles">
        Things like "SYDE is tight, fun, chill, wide range of topics" are what most people hear. And though true, also be prepared to struggle a little. Unlike highschool, things (such as calc) aren't as easy to understand or do AMAZING in. So it might destroy your self esteem but also remember it is 1A and its a huge change, especially with all the covid school years.
        So for sure, COME TO SYDE its FUN and also keep in mind you will need to work. :)

        Don't worry about your drop in grades, just focus on picking up the key concepts from each class and grind coop, cuz thats what matters the most.

        Don't let your grades define you. You're never going to be able to do absolutely everything so don't let it beat you up. Make time for fun, your mental health is significantly more important than your grades. Find a study buddy you work well with and make a commitment to each other.
